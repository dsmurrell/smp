	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci700257y},
	doi = {10.1021/ci700257y},
	abstract = {We have developed a new method, i.e., {XLOGP3}, for {logP} computation. {XLOGP3} predicts the {logP} value of a query compound by using the known {logP} value of a reference compound as a starting point. The difference in the {logP} values of the query compound and the reference compound is then estimated by an additive model. The additive model implemented in {XLOGP3} uses a total of 87 atom/group types and two correction factors as descriptors. It is calibrated on a training set of 8199 organic compounds with reliable {logP} data through a multivariate linear regression analysis. For a given query compound, the compound showing the highest structural similarity in the training set will be selected as the reference compound. Structural similarity is quantified based on topological torsion descriptors. {XLOGP3} has been tested along with its predecessor, i.e., {XLOGP2}, as well as several popular {logP} methods on two independent test sets:? one contains 406 small-molecule drugs approved by the {FDA} and the other contains 219 oligopeptides. On both test sets, {XLOGP3} produces more accurate predictions than most of the other methods with average unsigned errors of 0.24?0.51 units. Compared to conventional additive methods, {XLOGP3} does not rely on an extensive classification of fragments and correction factors in order to improve accuracy. It is also able to utilize the ever-increasing experimentally measured {logP} data more effectively.},
