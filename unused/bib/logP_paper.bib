	abstract = {Good and extensive experimental {ADMET} (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) data is critical for developing reliable in silico {ADMET} models. Here we develop a {PharmacoKinetics} Knowledge Base {(PKKB)} to compile comprehensive information about {ADMET} properties into a single electronic repository. We incorporate more than 10?000 experimental {ADMET} measurements of 1685 drugs into the {PKKB.} The {ADMET} properties in the {PKKB} include octanol/water partition coefficient, solubility, dissociation constant, intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, human bioavailability, plasma protein binding, blood-plasma partitioning ratio, volume of distribution, metabolism, half-life, excretion, urinary excretion, clearance, toxicity, half lethal dose in rat or mouse, etc. The {PKKB} provides the most extensive collection of freely available data for {ADMET} properties up to date. All these {ADMET} properties, as well as the pharmacological information and the calculated physiochemical properties are integrated into a web-based information system. Eleven separated data sets for octanol/water partition coefficient, solubility, blood-brain partitioning, intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, human oral bioavailability, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been provided for free download and can be used directly for {ADMET} modeling. The {PKKB} is available online at http://cadd.suda.edu.cn/admet .},

	abstract = {The log n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Po/w) still represents one of the most informative physicochemical parameters available to medicinal chemists. In the present work, principles, methodologies, and parameters are briefly reviewed for a variety of models developed to predict this parameter based on molecular structure. To include the developments of recent years, a total of more than 40 different approaches are mentioned with relevant bibliography within four major categories: group contribution methods, atomic contribution methods, molecular methods, and other physicochemical methods. To underscore once more the utility of this partition coefficient, a comprehensive and reevaluated correlation between log Po/w and in vivo permeability data of rat brain capillaries is included. Most deviants that fell below the trendline are those that have been recently found to be substrates for P-glycoprotein, a multidrug transporter that actively removes them from the brain. Accurate predictions of log Po/w may necessitate many parameters, but there is mounting evidence that molecular size and hydrogen bonding ability can account for a major part of the variance. Our recently developed, molecular size-based approach is reviewed, and it is argued that introduction of three-dimensionality allows the elimination of many empirically derived fragment constants without a significant deterioration of the predictive accuracy. A comparison of predictive power for six different methods on 145 molecules of interest for medicinal chemists is also included.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new method, i.e., {XLOGP3}, for {logP} computation. {XLOGP3} predicts the {logP} value of a query compound by using the known {logP} value of a reference compound as a starting point. The difference in the {logP} values of the query compound and the reference compound is then estimated by an additive model. The additive model implemented in {XLOGP3} uses a total of 87 atom/group types and two correction factors as descriptors. It is calibrated on a training set of 8199 organic compounds with reliable {logP} data through a multivariate linear regression analysis. For a given query compound, the compound showing the highest structural similarity in the training set will be selected as the reference compound. Structural similarity is quantified based on topological torsion descriptors. {XLOGP3} has been tested along with its predecessor, i.e., {XLOGP2}, as well as several popular {logP} methods on two independent test sets: one contains 406 small-molecule drugs approved by the {FDA} and the other contains 219 oligopeptides. On both test sets, {XLOGP3} produces more accurate predictions than most of the other methods with average unsigned errors of 0.24-0.51 units. Compared to conventional additive methods, {XLOGP3} does not rely on an extensive classification of fragments and correction factors in order to improve accuracy. It is also able to utilize the ever-increasing experimentally measured {logP} data more effectively.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of 'privileged' substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial. {RESULTS:} Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed 'underprivileged' substructures and 'conditional privilege'-rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.},

The major focus is on catalysis and nanofibers, enzymes and nanofibers, surface modification for biomedical and specialty applications, coatings of fibers, crosslinking, and bulk modifications.

A total of 30 and 18 methods were tested for public and industrial datasets, respectively. Accuracy of models declined with the number of nonhydrogen atoms. The Arithmetic Average Model {(AAM)}, which predicts the same value (the arithmetic mean) for all compounds, was used as a baseline model for comparison. Methods with Root Mean Squared Error {(RMSE)} greater than {RMSE} produced by the {AAM} were considered as unacceptable. The majority of analyzed methods produced reasonable results for the public dataset but only seven methods were successful on the both in house datasets. We proposed a simple equation based on the number of carbon atoms, {NC}, and the number of hetero atoms, {NHET:} log P = 1.46(+/-0.02) + 0.11(+/-0.001) {NC-0.11(+/-0.001)} {NHET.} This equation outperformed a large number of programs benchmarked in this study.
