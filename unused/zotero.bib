	abstract = {Lipophilicity is a crucial parameter in drug development since it impacts both {ADME} properties and target affinity of drug candidates. In early drug discovery stage, accurate tools for log P prediction are highly desired. Many calculation methods were developed to aid pharmaceutical scientists in drug research; however almost all suffer from insufficient accuracy and variation of performance in several regions of the chemical space associated with new chemical entities. The low predictive power of existing software packages can be explained by limited availability and/or variable quality of experimental log P values associated with training set used, which stem from various protocols and poorly cover chemical space. In this study, a dataset of 1000 diverse test compounds out of 4.5 million was generated; log P values of 759 purchasable compounds (46\% non-ionizable, 30\% basic, 17\% acidic, 0.5\% zwitterionic and 6.5\% ampholytes) from this selected set were experimentally determined by {UHPLC} followed by {UV} detection or {MS} detection when necessary. Finally, a data collection of 707 validated log P values ranging from 0.30 to 7.50 is now available for benchmarking of existing and development of new approaches to predict octanol/water partition coefficients of chemical compounds.},

In some instances there are no values available for any related structures which could serve as a parent; then, rather than substitute groups for hydrogen, it is easier to begin "from scratch", as suggested by Nys and Rekker, and assemble the structure from fragments, each of which has been assigned a hydrophobic value. In the present paper some new log P values for the lower alkanes and the inert gases are analyzed with the view of separating hydrophobic effects according to volume (including branching and flexibility) and polarity. Modified fragment values appear to enable reliable calculations to be made for a wider range of structures than was possible with the originally proposed constants.},

Analysis of 14 calculation methods revealed that the most accurate calculations are obtained when correction factors are used. We evaluated the correction factors used by Hansch and Leo in {CLOGP} in order to simplify their method. Most of the {CLOGP} structural factors are included in our fragmental increments. Aliphatic and aromatic factors are replaced with additive interfragmental increments. Missing increments are estimated by two empirical equations with simple physical interpretation. The final method uses three simple equations with several types of parameters. The training set included 3601 compounds and the correlation between experimental and calculated Log P values gave R = 0.992, S = 0.21. The method was validated by comparing it with 17 other methods on various data sets of independently selected drugs and other compounds. In all cases, our method produced the best results. The weakness of this method is that it uses a large number of individual increments for aromatic interactions. Each increment represents a combination of several effects which presently cannot be separated.},

A total of 30 and 18 methods were tested for public and industrial datasets, respectively. Accuracy of models declined with the number of nonhydrogen atoms. The Arithmetic Average Model ({AAM)}, which predicts the same value (the arithmetic mean) for all compounds, was used as a baseline model for comparison. Methods with Root Mean Squared Error ({RMSE)} greater than {RMSE} produced by the {AAM} were considered as unacceptable. The majority of analyzed methods produced reasonable results for the public dataset but only seven methods were successful on the both in house datasets.

In the present work, principles, methodologies, and parameters are briefly reviewed for a variety of models developed to predict this parameter based on molecular structure. To include the developments of recent years, a total of more than 40 different approaches are mentioned with relevant bibliography within four major categories: group contribution methods, atomic contribution methods, molecular methods, and other physicochemical methods. To underscore once more the utility of this partition coefficient, a comprehensive and reevaluated correlation between log Po/w and in vivo permeability data of rat brain capillaries is included. Most deviants that fell below the trendline are those that have been recently found to be substrates for P-glycoprotein, a multidrug transporter that actively removes them from the brain. Accurate predictions of log Po/w may necessitate many parameters, but there is mounting evidence that molecular size and hydrogen bonding ability can account for a major part of the variance. Our recently developed, molecular size-based approach is reviewed, and it is argued that introduction of three-dimensionality allows the elimination of many empirically derived fragment constants without a significant deterioration of the predictive accuracy. A comparison of predictive power for six different methods on 145 molecules of interest for medicinal chemists is also included.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new method, i.e., {XLOGP3}, for {logP} computation. {XLOGP3} predicts the {logP} value of a query compound by using the known {logP} value of a reference compound as a starting point. The difference in the {logP} values of the query compound and the reference compound is then estimated by an additive model. The additive model implemented in {XLOGP3} uses a total of 87 atom/group types and two correction factors as descriptors. It is calibrated on a training set of 8199 organic compounds with reliable {logP} data through a multivariate linear regression analysis. For a given query compound, the compound showing the highest structural similarity in the training set will be selected as the reference compound. Structural similarity is quantified based on topological torsion descriptors. {XLOGP3} has been tested along with its predecessor, i.e., {XLOGP2}, as well as several popular {logP} methods on two independent test sets:? one contains 406 small-molecule drugs approved by the {FDA} and the other contains 219 oligopeptides. On both test sets, {XLOGP3} produces more accurate predictions than most of the other methods with average unsigned errors of 0.24?0.51 units. Compared to conventional additive methods, {XLOGP3} does not rely on an extensive classification of fragments and correction factors in order to improve accuracy. It is also able to utilize the ever-increasing experimentally measured {logP} data more effectively.},

The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 {1D}, {2D} descriptors, and 134 {3D} descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors, {McGowan} volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and {Roth.MethodsPaDEL-Descriptor} was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a {Master/Worker} pattern to take advantage of the multiple {CPU} cores that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular {descriptors.ResultsThe} software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, {MacOS)}, supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is {multithreaded.ConclusionPaDEL-Descriptor} is a useful addition to the currently available molecular descriptor calculation software.

	abstract = {Motivation: Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of ‘privileged’ substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial.
Results: Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed ‘underprivileged’ substructures and ‘conditional privilege’—rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.

Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules.

	abstract = {Following studies in the late 1990s that indicated that poor pharmacokinetics and toxicity were important causes of costly late-stage failures in drug development, it has become widely appreciated that these areas should be considered as early as possible in the drug discovery process. However, in recent years, combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening have significantly increased the number of compounds for which early data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion ({ADME)} and toxicity (T) are needed, which has in turn driven the development of a variety of medium and high-throughput in vitro {ADMET} screens. Here, we describe how in silico approaches will further increase our ability to predict and model the most relevant pharmacokinetic, metabolic and toxicity endpoints, thereby accelerating the drug discovery process.},

	abstract = {Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in discovery and development settings are described. In the discovery setting ‘the rule of 5’ predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 Hbond donors, 10 Hbond acceptors, the molecular weight ({MWT)} is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P ({CLogP)} is greater than 5 (or {MlogP} \&gt; 4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P ({MLogP)} calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening ({HTS)} leads tend to have higher {MWT} and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-{HTS} era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

	abstract = {This volume covers all aspects of the antibiotic discovery and development process through Phase {II/III.} The contributors, a group of highly experienced individuals in both academics and industry, include chapters on the need for new antibiotic compounds, strategies for screening for new antibiotics, sources of novel synthetic and natural antibiotics, discovery phases of lead development and optimization, and candidate compound nominations into development. Beyond discovery , the handbook will cover all of the studies to prepare for {IND} submission: Phase I (safety and dose ranging), progression to Phase {II} (efficacy), and Phase {III} (capturing desired initial indications). This book walks the reader through all aspects of the process, which has never been done before in a single reference. With the rise of antibiotic resistance and the increasing view that a crisis may be looming in infectious diseases, there are strong signs of renewed emphasis in antibiotic research. The purpose of the handbook is to offer a detailed overview of all aspects of the problem posed by antibiotic discovery and development.},
